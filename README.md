## Introduction

Differential is a website designed to help people with basic knowledge of differencial calculus to understand the relevance of differential equations to represent mathematically physical problems. Differential guides the user to describe a simple problem, namely mechanical relaxation, in a single or set of differential equations.

### User stories based on UX experience

#### First time user

- As first time user, I need to find a friendly page to sig-up.
- As first time user, after signing-up I need to find a description of the website including instructions.
- As first time user, I need to be able to easily use the site game to familiarise.

#### Second time user

- As a second time user,

#### First time user

- A first time user I will find a login page with clearly indicated suscribe links
- As a first time user, after filling the suscribe page fields and clicking on suscribe button, the user will be redirected to the userpage.
- As a first time user, the user page will show me a welcome message and a small burger button to show my details and log out link. Immediately after, I found a section explaining the intention of the website, the case of study and instructions. The game area below is divided in three abouts. The left one contains the playground, where a mechanic device can be easily built. The cetral and right about are uptated live with the physics and mathematics describing the device.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
